UE_5.0.3 2DSideScrollerBP Template files

I do not claim to own any of this content, it is all content given to users in Unreal Engine 4.27.2 that I have
converted to work with Unreal Engine 5.0.3. The steps in the video that brought you to this point will show you
hot to make these files yourself in case you dont want to trust these files. 

Special thanks to @GameDevXR's content @ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u87ysSUtT0w&t=204s in helping me figure
out how to fix this missing content.


To setup the template:

Unzip & move the above folder named 'TP_2DSideScrollerBP' to your epic games template folder.

By default this is located at C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.0\Templates

HOWEVER if you have moved the standard install location it will be located where you put it

Restart your UE5 and find the template under 'games' menu.
